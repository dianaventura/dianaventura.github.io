My name is Diana. I like to ride my bicycle and stare at people when they are not looking. I grew up around South America, France and mostly Scotland. I am too sensitive and easily distracted to make pieces that fit together but as I start this new journey of sharing and joining my pieces I hope at some point along the way someone sees this and it makes sense to them :)
